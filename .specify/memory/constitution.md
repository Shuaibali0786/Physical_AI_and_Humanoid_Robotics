# Unified Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics with Integrated RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
Ensure all technical descriptions, simulations, and AI implementations are verified against primary sources, official documentation, and research papers.

### Clarity
Content must be understandable to students and practitioners with a computer science and robotics background.

### Reproducibility
All code examples, ROS 2 setups, simulations in Gazebo/Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac workflows must be fully reproducible.

### Rigor
Prefer peer-reviewed sources, official SDK documentation, and authoritative robotics/AI references.

### Practical relevance
Focus on bridging AI theory to real-world humanoid robotics applications.

### Factual Integrity
All technical claims must be supported by verifiable sources, with minimum 50% from peer-reviewed articles or official robotics/AI documentation.

## Standards and Requirements
Citation format: APA style; Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 readability; Code correctness: All code examples must be tested and verified.

## Development Workflow
Content must be traceable to authoritative sources; Prefer official documentation and peer-reviewed research; All simulations and implementations must be reproducible.

## Governance
All content must comply with the stated principles; Factual claims must be verifiable; Citations must follow APA format; Content must maintain grade 10-12 readability.
