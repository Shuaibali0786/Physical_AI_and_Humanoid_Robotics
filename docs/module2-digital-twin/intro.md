# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). This module explores the critical role of digital twin technology in humanoid robotics development. Digital twins provide virtual environments where robots can be designed, tested, and trained before deployment in the real world, significantly reducing development time and costs while improving safety.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How to simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- Techniques for high-fidelity rendering in Unity
- Methods for simulating various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- The relationship between URDF and SDF formats
- How to set up comprehensive Gazebo environments

## Module Overview

Digital twin technology enables safe, cost-effective development of humanoid robots by providing realistic virtual environments for testing and validation. This module covers both Gazebo and Unity, two of the most powerful simulation platforms in robotics.
