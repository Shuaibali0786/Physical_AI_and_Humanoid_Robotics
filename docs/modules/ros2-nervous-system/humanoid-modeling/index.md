# Humanoid Robot Modeling with URDF

This section covers the creation of humanoid robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format). URDF is an XML-based format that describes robots in terms of links, joints, and other elements necessary for modeling robotic systems.

## Overview

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is the standard format for representing robot models in ROS. It allows you to define the physical structure of a robot, including its kinematic chain, visual properties, and collision properties.

## Key Concepts

- **URDF**: XML-based robot description format
- **Links**: Rigid parts of the robot
- **Joints**: Connections between links
- **Materials**: Visual appearance properties
- **Inertial properties**: Mass, center of mass, and inertia tensor
- **Collision models**: Simplified geometry for collision detection

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Create URDF files that accurately represent humanoid robot structures
- Understand the relationship between URDF and robot simulation
- Validate URDF files for correctness
- Visualize URDF models in RViz
