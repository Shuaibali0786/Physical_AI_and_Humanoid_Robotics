# Python Agents & ROS 2 Integration

This section covers how to integrate Python agents with ROS 2 using the rclpy library. Python's rich ecosystem of AI and robotics libraries makes it an excellent choice for creating intelligent robotic applications.

## Overview

Python integration with ROS 2 is accomplished through the `rclpy` package, which provides Python bindings for the ROS 2 client library. This allows Python developers to create ROS 2 nodes that can communicate with other nodes in the system.

## Key Concepts

- **rclpy**: Python client library for ROS 2
- **Node creation**: Creating ROS 2 nodes in Python
- **Publisher/Subscriber**: Implementing pub-sub pattern in Python
- **Service/Client**: Implementing request-response pattern in Python
- **Parameter management**: Handling parameters in Python nodes

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Create Python nodes that communicate with other ROS 2 nodes using rclpy
- Implement publishers, subscribers, services, and clients in Python
- Create Python agents that interact with ROS 2 systems
