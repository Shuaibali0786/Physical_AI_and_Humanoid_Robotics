# ROS 2 Basics & Middleware

This section covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture including nodes, topics, and services. Understanding these concepts is essential for working with robotic systems.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous, goal-based communication

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Explain the differences between nodes, topics, and services
- Create a simple publisher-subscriber example
- Understand the ROS 2 communication patterns
