## Learning Objectives

- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Learn how to integrate Python agents with ROS 2
- Master the creation of humanoid robot models using URDF

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of robotics concepts

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main sections:
1. ROS 2 Basics & Middleware
2. Python Agents & ROS 2 Integration
3. Humanoid Robot Modeling with URDF

Each section builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2 in the context of humanoid robotics.
