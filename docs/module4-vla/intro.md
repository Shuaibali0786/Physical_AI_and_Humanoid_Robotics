# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA). This module explores the cutting-edge integration of vision, language, and action systems in humanoid robotics. VLA represents a paradigm shift toward more natural human-robot interaction, where robots can understand complex verbal commands, perceive their environment visually, and execute appropriate physical actions in response.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How to implement voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper
- Techniques for cognitive planning with LLMs to control ROS 2 actions
- Methods for speech recognition and natural language understanding
- Multi-modal interaction combining speech, gesture, and vision
- How to develop a capstone project for autonomous humanoid operation

## Module Overview

Vision-Language-Action systems enable humanoid robots to interact with humans in more natural, intuitive ways. This module covers the technical foundations and practical implementation of VLA systems, combining state-of-the-art AI technologies with robotic control to create more capable and user-friendly robots.
