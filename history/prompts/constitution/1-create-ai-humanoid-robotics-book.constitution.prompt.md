## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution

Project: Unified Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics with Integrated RAG Chatbot

Core principles:
- Accuracy: Ensure all technical descriptions, simulations, and AI implementations are verified against primary sources, official documentation, and research papers.
- Clarity: Content must be understandable to students and practitioners with a computer science and robotics background.
- Reproducibility: All code examples, ROS 2 setups, simulations in Gazebo/Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac workflows must be fully reproducible.
- Rigor: Prefer peer-reviewed sources, official SDK documentation, and authoritative robotics/AI references.
- Practical relevance: Focus on bridging AI theory to real-world humanoid robotics applications.

Key standards:
- Factual claims must be traceable to sources or official documentation.
- Citation format: APA style.
- Source types: Minimum 50% peer-reviewed articles or official robotics/AI docs.
- Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 readability.
- Code correctn
