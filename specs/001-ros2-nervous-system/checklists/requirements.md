# Specification Quality Checklist: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-13
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Content about ROS 2 is the subject matter, not implementation of the book itself
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Appropriate for CS and robotics students
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Subject matter is appropriately described

## Notes

- All validation items have been completed successfully
- Specification is ready for planning phase
